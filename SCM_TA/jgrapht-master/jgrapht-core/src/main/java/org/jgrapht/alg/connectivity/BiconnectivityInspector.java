/**
 * Allows obtaining various connectivity aspects of a graph. The <i>inspected graph</i> is specified
 * at construction time and cannot be modified. No restrictions are imposed on the input graph.
 * Multigraphs and pseudographs are also supported.
 * The inspector traverses connected
 * components (undirected graphs) or weakly connected components (directed graphs). To find
 * strongly connected components, use {@link KosarajuStrongConnectivityInspector} instead. This class
 * offers an alternative implementation of some of the functionality encountered in {@link ConnectivityInspector}. It
 * is likely to perform somewhat slower than {@link ConnectivityInspector}, but offers more functionality in return.
 * <p>
 * The algorithm implemented in this class is Hopcroft and Tarjan's biconnected components algorithm, described in:
 * Hopcroft, J. Tarjan, R. Algorithm 447: efficient algorithms for graph manipulation, 1973. Communications of the ACM. 16 (6): 372â€“378.
 * This implementation runs in linear time $O(|V|+|E|)$ and is based on a recursive depth-first search.
 * More information about this subject be be found in this wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biconnected_component">article</a>.

 * <p>
 * The inspector methods work in a lazy fashion: no computations are performed unless immediately
 * necessary. Computation are done once and results are cached within this class for future need.
 * The core of this class is built around a recursive Depth-first search.

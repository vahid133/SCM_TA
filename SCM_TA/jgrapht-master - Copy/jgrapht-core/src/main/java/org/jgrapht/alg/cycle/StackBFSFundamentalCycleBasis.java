/**
 * Generate a set of fundamental cycles by building a spanning tree (forest) using an implementation
 * of BFS using a LIFO Stack. The implementation first constructs the spanning forest and then
 * builds the fundamental-cycles set. It supports graphs with self-loops and/or graphs with multiple
 * (parallel) edges.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The algorithm constructs the same fundamental cycle basis as the algorithm in the following
 * paper: K. Paton, An algorithm for finding a fundamental set of cycles for an undirected linear
 * graph, Comm. ACM 12 (1969), pp. 514-518.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The total length of the fundamental-cycle set can be as large as O(n^3) where n is the number of
 * vertices of the graph.

 * An edge factory used by graphs for creating new edges.

 * A graph uses the edge factory to create new edge objects whenever a user calls method

 * method {@link Graph#addEdge(Object, Object, Object)} to add the edge.
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that when used inside a {@link Graph} the edge factory must return unique objects on each
 * call.
